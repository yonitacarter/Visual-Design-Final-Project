        <h1>Yonita's Bespoke Events</h1>
        <p>For this assessment, I created mockups for a website for bespoke events, which I intend to develop further,
            as part of my new business initiative. I recently completed a Diploma for Event management and drew
            inspiration for the current website from my experience in organizing various events for this qualification,
            as well as from working on and organizing different types of events for friends and family. The images I
            used for the mockups are manipulated and optimized in various ways and the animated gif is aimed
            to be used for an Instagram story, encouraging engagement with my website. </p>
