        <h1>MOCKUPS</h1>
        <p>I have created four desktop 1920x 1080px mockups of four pages of the website, as per assessment
            requirements.</p>
        <p>All colours are in RGB mode, to be suitable for web. All headings are using the darker colour of the logo for
            consistency.</p>

        <h1>Home page</h1>
        <img src="C:\Users\yonit\vd-project\Event_design\event_homepage.jpg" alt="">

        <p>The Home page is scrollable, containing different sections. It starts with the header, where on the left is
            the logo as per design principles and on the right are the Call To Action buttons.</p>
        <p>Then follows the HERO or slider section. The image is taken from freepik.com.</p>
        <p>I have used smart filters to create smart objects in order to preserve the image quality.</p>
        <p>The font used is Poppins, which is downloaded from google fonts and is a trendy font used by designers at the
            moment.</p>
        <p>Following is the About section, then the Zone of Trust. In each section I have included one of my six
            manipulated images.</p>
        <p>The next section is Our events, followed by a Power Message, which is also a manipulated image with text.</p>
        <p>Lastly, the footer, which contains quick links to internal pages.</p>
        <p>This mockup is created using Adobe Photoshop. I have firstly created wireframes and then added the images.
            The margin is 80px left and right. The mockup image is saved for web in jpg format, with dimensions
            1920x7051 and size 6.05MB.</p>

        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <img src="C:\Users\yonit\vd-project\Event_design\event_about.jpg" alt="About">

        <p>For this mockup I used the guiding lines of the grid to help me divide the space. I included two of my
            manipulated images and some lorem text. I have also adjusted the colour to match the logo colours for
            consistency.</p>


        <h1>Our Events</h1>
        <img src="C:\Users\yonit\vd-project\Event_design\event_eventPage.jpg" alt="our events">

        <p>For this mockup I created five rectangles and used two manipulated images and three additional ones from
            unsplash.com. On each image I added the text of the Call to Action buttons.</p>

        <h1>Contact Us</h1>
        <img src="C:\Users\yonit\vd-project\Event_design\event_contacts.jpg" alt="contacts">

        <p>For this mockup, I also used one of the manipulated images behind the contact form. The form image is also
            manipulated using filter with shadow blur on the layer and hard light blending mode to achieve the shadow
            effect at the edges of the form images. I have again included a Call to action (Letâ€™s talk).</p>
